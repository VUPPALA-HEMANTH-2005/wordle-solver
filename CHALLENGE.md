# Programming Challenge - Wordle Solver

### Problem Statement

Wordle is a popular word game in which the player has to guess a five-letter word.

- Check out the rules and play today's [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). You can play multiple games at [Wordly](https://wordly.org/) to get a hang of the game.
- The challenge is to build a wordle solver that can assist you in solving the game.

> [!TIP]
> Check out the [wordle bot](https://ybenhayun.github.io/wordlebot/) to get an idea of what's expected from your wordle solver.

##### Guidelines

- This is the [list](WordleAnswersList.txt) of all possible wordle answers and this is [set](FiveLetterWords.txt) of all possible valid guesses.
- Your wordle solver can be written in any language of your choice.
- Your solution can be a CLI (Command Line Interface) application. However a GUI or TUI will garner more brownie points.
- Your solution will be scored based on the following criteria:
  1. Correctness
  2. Optimality
  3. Good software practices such as modularity, readability, code quality, documentation (adding a README.md file), etc.
  4. Memory and Run-time efficiency
  5. Elegance
- To submit your solution you can use any of the following methods (they are in the increasing order of brownie points):

  - As a zip file
  - Submit a link to your github repository
  - Fork this repository and create a pull request.

- Fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScouBuDeG-ncgLcF9OkEt4HLFaC-nhHMfNjlH5fBBphAkvWVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)
  to submit your solution as per your choice on or before **27th October 2024**.

> [!TIP]
> You can refer to this [quick tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdAHXoRtos&t=43s) to get started with git and look into other detailed tutorials available online as per need.

- You can refer to articles or videos on various algorithms and approaches to solve the problem. However we strongly discourage any form of plagiarism.

- It would be great if you could design your own solution and explain the logic behind it.
- Achieving feature parity with the [wordle bot](https://ybenhayun.github.io/wordlebot/) would be commendable (without looking at its source code :) ).

> [!CAUTION]
> **Only for programmers with nerves of steel!**
> Your mission, should you choose to accept it (and you totally should, because who doesn’t want to be a Wordle wizard?), is to develop a solution that lets our bot solve the Wordle game without any human intervention. That’s right—no peeking, no hints, just pure, unadulterated automation!
>Think of it like training your pet goldfish to fetch the newspaper. If you succeed, you’ll be the proud parent of a bot that can outsmart all your friends at Wordle while you sit back, relax, and snack on your favorite treats. Happy coding!
